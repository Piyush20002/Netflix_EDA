        "`director`, `cast`, `country`, `date_added`, and `rating` were filled with `\"Unknown\"` or appropriate replacements. The `date_added` column was converted to a datetime format, from which a new column `year_added` was extracted to analyze content addition trends over time. The `duration` column, which contains both movie durations (in minutes) and TV show lengths (in seasons), was cleaned and parsed using regular expressions to create three new columns: `duration_num`, `duration_mins`, and `duration_seasons`. Label encoding was applied to categorical features like `type`, `country`, `rating`, and `listed_in`, creating numerical representations for use in clustering and modeling, while the original readable formats were preserved for interpretation. Data types were corrected throughout, ensuring columns like `country` remained as strings for better visualization.\n",

        "Through detailed univariate, bivariate, and multivariate analysis (UBM), several insights were discovered. The majority of Netflix content is composed of movies, particularly those around 90–100 minutes long. Most of the content has been added after 2016, indicating the platform’s rapid growth. The United States, India, and the United Kingdom are the leading producers of Netflix content. Ratings such as TV-MA and TV-14 dominate, suggesting a focus on mature content. October and July emerged as peak months for content additions. Genre analysis revealed that Dramas, International TV Shows, and Comedies are the most popular categories. Additionally, multivariate analysis and K-Means clustering identified three distinct groups of content based on release year and duration, which can help personalize recommendations and improve content **segmentation**. These insights suggest business opportunities such as expanding the TV show library to boost retention, diversifying content ratings to target broader demographics, and using seasonal trends to optimize release strategies.\n"
